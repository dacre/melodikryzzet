# Melodikryzzet
A React app for creating and sharing crossword puzzles.

The inspiration for the project came from the idea of creating my own version of Melodikrysset (https://sverigesradio.se/melodikrysset), a Swedish radio show that has been running for at least 50 years.

I got annyoed by the fact that the official app didn't consider words in an angle so the user had to manually change the typing direction in the puzzle.
My solution automatically detect the next letter in the word and adjuts the direction of typing.
